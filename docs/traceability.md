# Requirement-to-Test Traceability

Maps each major original-prompt requirement to concrete backend test files and primary assertions.

## Legend

- **Unit** — `repo/backend/unit_tests/`
- **API** — `repo/backend/api_tests/`
- ✓ = covered by existing test
- [DB] = full happy-path test requires migrated DB (run via `run_tests.sh` inside Docker)

---

## 0. Post-Audit Remediation Snapshot (Static)

- All 44 endpoint gaps identified in `.tmp/test_coverage_and_readme_audit_report.md` now have direct `app.inject` coverage in depth suites.
- Added endpoint-complete coverage for parameterized/detail/mutation routes across admin, CMS, membership, outbound, strategy, and warehouse domains.
- Removed the prior API-suite mocking exception in `api/admin.depth.test.ts`; fail-closed behavior is now validated through strict-mode runtime configuration without dependency mocking.
- Added repository-layer unit coverage in:
	- `unit/repositories/warehouse.repository.test.ts`
	- `unit/repositories/membership.repository.test.ts`
	- `unit/repositories/outbound.repository.test.ts`
	- `unit/repositories/strategy.repository.test.ts`
- Updated `repo/README.md` and `repo/run_tests.sh` to align with the Docker-first execution model and backend-only project classification.

## 1. Authentication & Roles

| Requirement | Test File | Primary Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Local username/password login | `api/auth.test.ts`, `api/auth.depth.test.ts` | Schema validation plus DB-backed login success and `/api/auth/me` token usage |
| Session issuance (opaque token, SHA-256 hash stored) | `unit/security/session.test.ts` | generateSessionToken returns 64-char hex; hashSessionToken is idempotent |
| Password rotation | `api/auth.test.ts`, `api/auth.depth.test.ts` | Unauthorized path plus DB-backed rotation invalidates prior sessions |
| Scrypt password hashing | `unit/security/password.test.ts` | hashPassword produces non-plaintext hash; verifyPassword returns true/false |
| Session token hash (SHA-256) | `unit/security/session.test.ts` | hashSessionToken matches expected output |
| RBAC — 7 roles | `unit/enums.test.ts` | Role enum has exactly 7 values |
| RBAC guards on protected routes | `api/warehouse.test.ts`, `api/outbound.test.ts`, `api/warehouse.depth.test.ts` | 401 for missing auth and 403 for role mismatch on manager-only operations |
| Rate limiting (120 req/min, burst 30) | `unit/security/ratelimit.test.ts` | minute-window and burst-window evaluators enforce limits and reset on expiry |
| IP allowlist enforcement | `unit/security/ipallowlist.test.ts` | isIpAllowed returns false when not in CIDR; open when no active entries |
| IP allowlist fail-closed mode (`IP_ALLOWLIST_STRICT_MODE=true`) | `unit/security/ipallowlist.test.ts`, `unit/config.test.ts` | isIpAllowed(…, { failClosed: true }) denies when no active entries; config reads env var |
| IP CIDR matching | `unit/admin/parameterKey.test.ts` | isIpInCidr covers /24, /8, /32, 0.0.0.0/0 |
| IP CIDR canonical prefix rejection | `unit/services/admin.service.test.ts` | addIpAllowlistEntry rejects non-canonical prefixes such as `/08` and `/+8` |
| Append-only audit events | `unit/audit/audit.test.ts` | auditCreate, auditUpdate, auditTransition produce expected shape |
| Log safety (no password/key in logs) | `unit/logging/logger.test.ts` | domain logger uses structured JSON, while redact policy is configured in `src/app.ts` |
| Response masking by role | `unit/security/masking.test.ts` | maskEmail/maskPhone/maskMemberNumber/maskPaymentLast4 by role |
| Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM) | `unit/security/encryption.test.ts` | encryptFieldString/decryptFieldString round-trip |
| Key version envelope (version byte prefix) | `unit/admin/backup.test.ts` | encryptBuffer embeds version as first 4 bytes |
| 180-day key rotation (manual + automatic scheduler) | `api/admin.test.ts`, `unit/services/keyrotation.scheduler.test.ts`, `unit/config.test.ts` | Manual rotate endpoint remains protected; scheduler initializes/rotates/no-ops correctly; scheduler env flags parsed |

## 8. Cross-Cutting Security

| Requirement | Test File | Primary Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| AES-256-GCM field encryption | `unit/security/encryption.test.ts` | encryptFieldString/decryptFieldString round-trip; empty string handled |
| HKDF key derivation per version | `unit/admin/backup.test.ts` | Different version numbers produce different effective keys (decryption fails with wrong version if key is changed) |

## 11. Current Static Audit Alignment

Attestation that each audit checkpoint has a corresponding evidence source in the repo, including newly added depth and validation-envelope suites.

| Audit Checkpoint | Evidence Source |
|---|---|
| Repo structure compliance | `repo/README.md` (tree), `docs/design.md` §3, top-level `ls`; no `sessions/`, no root `unit_tests/`, no root `questions.md`, no `repo/frontend/` |
| Backend-only scope | No `repo/frontend/`; Dockerfile/compose reference only `backend` service |
| Docs present & synchronized | `docs/{design,api-spec,traceability,questions}.md`, `repo/README.md` all present and cross-linked |
| Port / path / volume consistency | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + `README.md` + `config.ts` + `run_tests.sh` all align on port 3000, `/app/database`, `/app/backups`, `greencycle-data`, `greencycle-backups` |
| Env var surface documented | `README.md` "Configuration" table + `docs/design.md` §22 table + `unit/config.test.ts` coverage |
| Security boundaries (auth + RBAC + rate + IP + audit + mask + encrypt) | `unit/security/*.test.ts` (6 files), `api/*.test.ts` 401 coverage across all protected routes, `unit/audit/audit.test.ts`, `unit/admin/backup.test.ts` |
| Append-only audit events | `src/audit/audit.ts`, `unit/audit/audit.test.ts` |
| Log redaction | `src/app.ts` Pino redact paths, `unit/logging/logger.test.ts` |
| Endpoint closure from prior static audit (44/44) | `api/admin.depth.test.ts`, `api/cms.depth.test.ts`, `api/membership.depth.test.ts`, `api/outbound.depth.test.ts`, `api/strategy.depth.test.ts`, `api/warehouse.depth.test.ts` |
| API-suite mocking exception removed | `api/admin.depth.test.ts` now validates strict-mode fail-closed behavior without `vi.spyOn(...).mockRejectedValueOnce(...)` |
| Business-logic presence (FSMs, idempotency, variance, shortage, strategy, CMS, tags) | See sections 1–10 above — depth suites add DB-backed assertions for critical paths |
| Backup + restore path-traversal prevention | `unit/admin/backup.test.ts` (validateSnapshotPath, GCM tamper detection) |
| Retention (7y billing / 2y operational) | `unit/admin/retention.test.ts`, `api/admin.test.ts` confirm routes |
| Key rotation + 180-day expiry | `api/admin.test.ts` rotate auth check, `unit/admin/backup.test.ts` version envelope |
| Requirement-to-test traceability | This document (sections 1–10 + this section) |
| Doc honesty (no stale acceptance claims) | `repo/README.md`, `docs/api-spec.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/questions.md` updated to remediation-state language |
| IP allowlist scope clearly documented | `docs/design.md` §18 route-group enforcement note, `docs/questions.md` #10 closing clarification |
| No Docker / test execution during implementation | Verified by absence of runtime artifacts (no `*.db`, no `node_modules` under `repo/backend`, no build output) |

## Notes on DB-Required Tests

Tests marked `[DB]` require a migrated SQLite database with fixture data and run fully inside Docker via `run_tests.sh`. These cover:

- **Happy paths**: create/read operations that touch Prisma
- **Not-found flows (404)**: retrieving non-existent resource IDs
- **Conflict paths (409)**: duplicate usernames, invoice numbers, SKU codes
- **State transition enforcement (409)**: illegal appointment/article transitions
- **Manager approval gating**: partial shipment approval flow
- **Idempotency replay**: wave generation returning cached response
- **Tag tombstone merge**: self-merge rejection, duplicate tag rejection
- **Encryption round-trips**: member field create/read with decrypt+mask

Tests that do NOT require a migrated DB (all currently authored):
- 401 unauthenticated access (auth middleware fires before DB)
- 400 schema validation failures (JSON Schema validates before DB)
- Pure function unit tests (no Prisma dependency)
